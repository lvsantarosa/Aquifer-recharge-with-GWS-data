This repository contains a script developed for the analysis of groundwater recharge using GroundWater Storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. 
The script is designed to calculate daily variations in groundwater levels, identify significant recharge and depletion events, and extract the annual maximum recharge values per pixel over a 
specified area of interest. The output includes both raster and shapefile formats, providing spatial insights into groundwater dynamics.
